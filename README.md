# House-Price-Prediction using Keras-ANN

Here i did a neural network approach for house price prediction.Artificial neural networks (ANN) or connectionist systems are computing systems that are inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute human brains. Such systems “learn” to perform tasks by considering examples, generally without being programmed with any task-specific rules. Deep Neural networks are just ANN’s with multiple hidden layers.
